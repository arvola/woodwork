&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a handful of kitchen utensils from a board of olive wood I got
from the Woodshop. &lt;a href="https://www.wood-database.com/olive/" target="_blank">Olive&lt;/a> is
a beautiful wood, it has very small, diffuse
pores that are easy to cover with any finish. It is heavy and very hard,
which is good for utensils. It is fairly unstable, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really
matter for utensils, as warping doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any real difference.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When working with olive, you can immediately smell the pleasant, fruity
aroma, similar to olive oil. It is known as a
&lt;a href="https://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/wood-allergies-and-toxicity/#sensitizer" target="_blank">sensitizer&lt;/a>,
so it&amp;rsquo;s best to
avoid long periods of working only on olive wood, exposure to the dust
over time can sensitize you to the wood and start causing allergic reactions.
Fortunately, that is not a concern for finished pieces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I start by drawing an outline of the utensil on a rectangular piece of wood.
I try to align it such that the grain follows the handle as much as possible,
while avoiding any obvious cracks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>With spoons, I carve the bowl first before anything else, since that&amp;rsquo;s easier
in dry wood while the piece is easy to clamp. I carve the bowl using the two
gauges I own: a large 1½ inch with a gentler sweep, and a ¾ inch half-circle.
Both have bevels on the outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, I use a curved &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_scraper" target="_blank">scraper&lt;/a>
to smooth the gouge marks out, and finish with sandpapers up to 600 grit.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="sawing.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I remove as much material as possible using saws, and then do the
shaping using chisels and a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokeshave" target="_blank">spokeshave&lt;/a>.
Final smoothing is done using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_scraper" target="_blank">card scraper&lt;/a> and sandpapers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I converted a few of the pieces into bowls instead of spoons due to cracks
or cavities in the wood that would be unsuitable for a spoon, but would be
fine in a bowl for dry goods. They are done using the same tools and methods,
just without a handle.&lt;/p>

&lt;figure>&lt;img src="00-stool.jpg"

&lt;p>After I finished the workbench, I made my first major purchase for
woodworking in the form of a stack of 10 foot long cherry lumber,
and a few pieces of walnut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The walnut was 6/4 (ie. 1.5 inches, or 35 mm), a perfect thickness for
creating a solid foot stool. It was a pretty straight-forward project to attempt,
and I wanted to keep it simple for my first furniture project. This one is
also a &lt;a href="https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/videos/foot-stool-project-info/" target="_blank">Paul Sellers project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="parts.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The legs were all shaped by hand using a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokeshave" target="_blank">spokeshave&lt;/a>. I found an
old Stanley 151 for sale at &lt;a href="https://hyperkitten.com/" target="_blank">Hyperkitten Tool Company&lt;/a>,
probably made in the 1910s. Using a spokeshave is very pleasing; it is
a very minimal tool. It&amp;rsquo;s very light and moves without much pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The holes in the base were made with a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_%28tool%29" target="_blank">brace and bit&lt;/a>, and it was
the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve used one. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as challenging to use as I
expected; with the 1&amp;quot; (26 mm) drill bit, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take very long.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="brace.jpg"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The legs go through the base, with glue on the mating surface. Wedges
are then tapped in with some more glue to create a mechanical joint
in addition to the glue. It&amp;rsquo;s a very strong joint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The protruding parts of the legs were then trimmed and the bottoms
leveled by scribing them on a flat surface. Finally, the stool was
finished with shellac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are quite a few small imperfections on the stool: the legs
don&amp;rsquo;t splay evenly, the tops of the legs have indentations from
scribing a sizing guide, and some tearing is visible in the wood.
They are fairly minor though, and certainly don&amp;rsquo;t detract from its
function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a similar stool about a year and a half later, and it was
clear how much my skills had improved. The second stool was sized
to fit a cat bed so our cats could sit up above the table and
watch us play board games.&lt;/p>
