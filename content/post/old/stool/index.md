This is a project I originally completed in 2018.

After I finished the workbench, I made my first major purchase for
woodworking in the form of a stack giant pieces of cherry lumber,
and a few pieces of walnut.

The walnut was 6/4 (ie. 1.5 inches, or 35 mm), a perfect thickness for
creating a solid foot stool. It was a pretty straight-forward project to attempt,
and I wanted to keep it simple for my first furniture project. This one is
also a [Paul Sellers project](https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/videos/foot-stool-project-info/).

The legs were all shaped by hand using a
[spokeshave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokeshave). I found an
old Stanley 151 for sale at [Hyperkitten Tool Company](https://hyperkitten.com/),
probably made in the 1910s. Using a spokeshave is very pleasing; it is
a very minimal tool. It's very light and moves without much pressure.

The holes in the base were made with a 
[brace and bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_(tool)), and it was
the first time I've used one. It wasn't as challenging to use as I
expected; with the 1" (26 mm) drill bit, it didn't take very long.

The legs go through the base, with glue on the mating surface. Wedges
are then tapped in with some more glue to create a mechanical joint
in addition to the glue. It's a very strong joint.

The protruding parts of the legs were then trimmed and the bottoms
leveled by scribing them on a flat surface. Finally, the stool was
finished with shellac.

There are quite a few small imperfections on the stool: the legs
don't splay evenly, the tops of the legs have indentations from
scribing a sizing guide, and some tearing is visible in the wood.
They are fairly minor though, and certainly don't detract from its
function.

I made a similar stool about a year and a half later, and it was
clear how much my skills had improved. The second stool was sized
to fit a cat bed so our cats could sit up above the table and
watch us play board games.
