This is a project I originally completed in 2019.

I designed a shrine to hold the ashes
and paw prints of our passed cats, with room for decorations and, of course,
live cats as well.

Several pieces of a pile of local cherry I bought had some highly figured
crotch at the ends of the boards. The design highlights the unusual figure
of those boards as a wide open shelf. I even left some of the bark on, and
just strengthened it with shellac.

At the left, I attached a side board using dovetails to the bottom shelf,
and then using a rabbet in the side board attached a back panel for the
smaller shelves. The back is also attached to the bottom using a dowel,
but that's only near the left edge to allow for wood movement.

The shelves were glued in mostly to the left board as well, rather than the
back. I wanted to make sure the movement of the back panel would not cause
issues.

I added little pegs to the perimiter of the small shelves to make sure cats 
couldn't knock the boxes out of the shelves. The pegs I made from a long dowel
of walnut

Lastly, I added another wider shelf at the top using another end piece,
as a place for cats to sit. This final shelf is attached with a mortise
and tenon through the shelf.
