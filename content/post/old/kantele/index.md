summary: A box zither called a kantele.

This is a project I originally completed in 2020.

A [kantele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantele) is a traditional
Finnish box zither, a string instrument. It is typically plucked or
strummed, but can also be used with a bow.

Since it was my first time building one, I found some pre-existing plans
from [Michael J King](http://www.michaeljking.com/index.htm). The plans
provided all the necessary information for sizing and placement for the
tuning pins.

I found some nice quarter-sawn sapele for the soundboard, a beautiful
wood that's also a decent tone wood. The sides of the frame are also
from the same board of sapele, and then for the rest I chose hard maple
as a good wood for holding the tuning pins and the stock steel bar.

When gluing the frame, I inserted a few dowels between the maple and
the sapele sides to stop movement during gluing. I added an additional piece
of sapele on the bottom of the maple head to complete the frame, and then
did shaping using chisels, gouges, rasps and files to finish off the shape
of the frame.

Next, it was time to attach the soundboard. I cut it to a very rough shape
first for gluing it to the frame, and then trimmed it down to match the
frame after.

I wanted to add some accent between the soundboard and the maple head,
so I made some strips of wood from bloodwood and wenge. The red and dark
colors complement the otherwise fairly light instrument very nicely.

With the frame and the soundboard complete, it only remained to add the main
stock that holds the steel bar for the strings to attach. I spent a lot of
time shaping the stock, since that's where the player's right hand rests most
of the time.

Before proceeding to add the hardware parts, I added the finish to the wood.
I wanted to do a classic french polishing, which is basically rubbing on
very, very thin layers of shellac to build up a hundred or more layers
of finish. It's time-consuming, but the outcome is stunning. Unfortunately
I forgot to take pictures of the process.

After finishing, I added the steel bar to the stock, drilled the holes for
the zither pins, and added strings.

Thank you for reading.
