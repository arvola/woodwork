This is a project I originally completed in 2018.

For a long time I wanted to get into woodworking. I had some experience through
school, as I always selected woodworking for elective classes. The projects at
school were always relatively simple and largely relied on machines, so that
remained in my mind as the definition of woodworking.

Based on those experiences, I occasionally researched the various machines I
would need to get for starting out. Generally speaking they're either poorly 
made or very expensive, and require a lot of room. That made me hold off on
getting started.

Then one day, by chance, I stumbled upon a series of videos by
[Paul Sellers](https://paulsellers.com/) where he builds a workbench.

What really captivated me was the minimal amount of tools used and the
lack of a workshop. There were no machines, no existing workbench, not
even a roof over his head. With a few hand tools and using cheap hardware
store lumber, he built a solid workbench.

It felt immediately accessible. "I could do this," I thought, with minimal
investment. I rented a pickup truck and bought about \$150 worth of 2x4 lumber
from a hardware store. I bought a few cheap chisels, a #4 plane by Woodriver,
two hand saws and some clamps.

First, I built two simple sawhorses, and I set an old hollow core door on top.

I followed Paul Seller's instructions more or less exactly, so I won't go
into too much detail on the build itself. One difference was that the wood
I got had much more rounded corners and wasn't as even, so it took more work
to flatten the slabs. To make that easier I bought a second plane, a
[Veritas scrub plane](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/planes/scrub/51871-veritas-scrub-plane).

## Hand tools

At this point I had watched and read more material by [Paul Sellers](https://paulsellers.com)
about using hand tools for woodworking, and I was finding that I enjoyed
the work immensely - more so than in the past with machines.

All your senses
tell you about the wood you're working with, rather than the machines. You feel
changes in the growth of the wood rather than vibrations of the tool. You hear
the texture of what you're working with rather than the deafening cacophony of
motors and high-speed blades. You breathe and smell the wood rather than wear
a dust mask constantly. To me it feels more like crafting with skill rather than just
building.

To be clear, I don't say that to seem somehow superior, it's mostly just my
preference. Power tools and machines have their advantages as well.

Overall hand tools take more time and effort, but I'm not in any hurry - it is a
hobby after all. Hand tools are also more of a learning experience, it takes a lot of 
practice to use them effectively.

I do still occasionally use power tools. I have a 
[brace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_(tool)) that I typically
use for larger holes, but for smaller ones I use a power drill. When I occasionally
need plywood panels, I usually cut those with a circular saw.

## Finishing the workbench

The only major change from the original was that I used a different vise. I got
a [vise mechanism by Veritas](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/workshop/workbenches/vises/67755-veritas-quick-release-front-vise?item=05G3401)
and made a heavy cherry jaw for it.

Thank you for reading the first post on my woodworking blog. I intend to write
up a record of my past projects, and this was the first one.
