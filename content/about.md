This will be a simple site logging my woodworking experiences.

I will try to update it as my projects move forward, and I intend
to slowly add posts for older projects.

A few technical details:

- It is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is responsible for turning the content into
  a website. I considered others as well, but Hugo seems to have the best
  support.
- The site is hosted on [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System),
  with the help of [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/).
  [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) makes the website accessible through a normal
  browser, instead of needing to support IPFS.
- The theme is based on [hugo-theme-texify](https://github.com/queensferryme/hugo-theme-texify/),
  I enjoy the academic look of LaTeX.
