<a class=link href=../../../tags/cherry>cherry</a></div><div class=content><p>This is a project originally done in 2018.</p><p>This is the first real piece of furniture I made, a full-size library cart
as a gift for my wife.</p><figure><img src=cart.jpg alt="Figure 1. The finished cart."><figcaption><p>Figure 1. The finished cart.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I had recently bought a large amount of cherry. The Woodshop had a big stack
of large cherry pieces from a locally cut down tree, and I bought everything
they had left. I believe it was around 120 board feet. It had lots of
beautiful figure, but without a lot of cracking, so ideal for fine furniture.</p><figure><img src=raw-ends.jpg alt="Figure 2. Both end pieces from a single board."><figcaption><p>Figure 2. Both end pieces from a single board.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I had a good idea of what I wanted the cart to be like, so I didn&rsquo;t look for
existing designs. I wanted it to be sturdy and solid, even if it was
overloaded with books. I did some rough calculations, and it should be
able to handle at least 400 kg of load (900 lb).</p><figure><img src=live-edge.jpg alt="Figure 3. Live edge before (bottom) and after cleanup."><figcaption><p>Figure 3. Live edge before (bottom) and after cleanup.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The pieces for the ends had a nice live edge, so I wanted to preserve it.
I cleaned up the bark with a pullshave, and then cleaned up the top layer
with a spokeshave and a gouge. I cut the opposite side so that the live
edge could be at the front of the cart, and the back a straight cut line
that narrows the cart slightly towards the top.</p><p>At the top of the ends, I rounded it off with a gentle curve, and then
cut a long opening following the curve to create a nice handle for pulling
the cart.</p><figure><img src=handle.jpg alt="Figure 4. Curved handle at the top."><figcaption><p>Figure 4. Curved handle at the top.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Laying out the joinery in the end pieces was a bit more challenging due to
the unusual shape and angle. I butted up the two pieces so that the inside
was facing up, clamped them down to prevent movement, and laid everything
out symmetrically from the middle.</p><figure><img src=layout.jpg alt="Figure 5. Laying out the joinery."><figcaption><p>Figure 5. Laying out the joinery.</p></figcaption></figure><p>It was slow going, and I was afraid of having issues with the markings not
matching up, but fortunately everything lined up beautifully.</p><p>I decided to use through tenons for the bottom rails and the top shelf,
and stopped tenons for the rest of the shelves. That way I could be sure
the overall structure held with the addition of wedges to the tenons, but
not adding unnecessary holes to the beautiful wood panels.</p><p>The large bottom shelf is angled back a little to keep books from sliding
forward as the cart is moved. It also makes it easier to see the spines of
the books. I made sure to leave a small gap at the back between the shelf
and the back board so dust and dirt wouldn&rsquo;t get trapped there.</p><figure><img src=ends.jpg alt="Figure 6. Ends laid out and cut."><figcaption><p>Figure 6. Ends laid out and cut.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I wanted to make sure the bottom of the cart could hold heavy casters,
so instead of using a shelf, I made two heavy rails. The rails are 2"
thick and about 4½" wide.</p><figure><img src=rails.jpg alt="Figure 7. Rails cut from a thicker piece."><figcaption><p>Figure 7. Rails cut from a thicker piece.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I added a lip to the short middle shelf, so when you push something to the
shelf, there&rsquo;s no chance of it falling out the back. I also added a lip to
the bottom of the top shelf for added rigidity, although I expect that wasn&rsquo;t
really necessary. The top shelf has no lip on top of it, so it&rsquo;s clear for
setting large things on it, or for using it as a table for a laptop.</p><figure><img src=lip.jpg alt="Figure 8. Gluing a lip to the short shelf."><figcaption><p>Figure 8. Gluing a lip to the short shelf.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to the heavy rails on the bottom, I could use large brass inserts for
holding bolts for the casters. I liked the idea of using the inserts to make
it possible to remove or change the casters without any concern for wearing
out a screw hole in wood.</p><div class=photo-gallery><div class=gallery-item><input type=radio id=8-gallery-0 checked name=gallery class=gallery-selector><div class=gallery-img><img src=caster-insert.jpg alt><div class=gallery-caption>Figure 9.

After 4 coats, I sanded
the surface to 600 grit, and rubbed it first with steel wool, and then with
pumice and mineral spirits to give it a smooth, dull glow.</p><figure><img src=cart2.jpg alt="Figure 13. Showing the smooth finish."><figcaption><p>Figure 13.
