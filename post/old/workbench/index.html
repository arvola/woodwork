school, as I always selected woodworking for elective classes. The projects at
school were always relatively simple and largely relied on machines, so that
remained in my mind as the definition of woodworking.</p><p>Based on those experiences, I occasionally researched the various machines I
would need to get for starting out. Generally speaking they&rsquo;re either poorly
made or very expensive, and require a lot of room. That made me hold off on
getting started.</p><p>Then one day, by chance, I stumbled upon a series of videos by
<a href=https://paulsellers.com/ target=_blank>Paul Sellers</a> where he builds a workbench.</p><figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru2ZiNs_Wek" target=_blank><img src=https://img.youtube.com/vi/ru2ZiNs_Wek/hq720.jpg alt="Figure 1. How to build a workbench by Paul Sellers"></a><figcaption><p>Figure 1. How to build a workbench by Paul Sellers</p></figcaption></figure><p>What really captivated me was the minimal amount of tools used and the
lack of a workshop. There were no machines, no existing workbench, not
even a roof over his head. With a few hand tools and using cheap hardware
store lumber, he built a solid workbench.</p><p>It felt immediately accessible. &ldquo;I could do this,&rdquo; I thought, with minimal
investment. I rented a pickup truck and bought about $150 worth of 2x4 lumber
from a hardware store. I bought a few cheap chisels, a #4 plane by Woodriver,
two hand saws and some clamps.</p><p>First, I built two simple sawhorses, and I set an old hollow core door on top.</p><figure><img src=workbench_1.jpg alt="Figure 2. Gluing the first of the two top slabs."><figcaption><p>Figure 2. Gluing the first of the two top slabs.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I followed Paul Seller&rsquo;s instructions more or less exactly, so I won&rsquo;t go
into too much detail on the build itself. One difference was that the wood
I got had much more rounded corners and wasn&rsquo;t as even, so it took more work
to flatten the slabs. To make that easier I bought a second plane, a

about using hand tools for woodworking, and I was finding that I enjoyed
the work immensely - more so than in the past with machines.</p><p>All your senses
tell you about the wood you&rsquo;re working with, rather than the machines. You feel
changes in the growth of the wood rather than vibrations of the tool. You hear
the texture of what you&rsquo;re working with rather than the deafening cacophony of
motors and high-speed blades. You breathe and smell the wood rather than wear
a dust mask constantly. To me it feels more like crafting with skill rather than just
building.</p><p>To be clear, I don&rsquo;t say that to seem somehow superior, it&rsquo;s mostly just my
preference. Power tools and machines have their advantages as well.</p><p>Overall hand tools take more time and effort, but I&rsquo;m not in any hurry - it is a
hobby after all. Hand tools are also more of a learning experience, it takes a lot of
practice to use them effectively.</p><p>I do still occasionally use power tools. I have a
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_%28tool%29 target=_blank>brace</a> that I typically
use for larger holes, but for smaller ones I use a power drill. When I occasionally
need plywood panels, I usually cut those with a circular saw.</p><h2 id=finishing-the-workbench>Finishing the workbench</h2><figure><img src=jaw.jpg alt="Figure 5. Shaping the vise jaw."><figcaption><p>Figure 5. Shaping the vise jaw.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The only major change from the original was that I used a different vise. I got
a <a href="https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/workshop/workbenches/vises/67755-veritas-quick-release-front-vise?item=05G3401" target=_blank>vise mechanism by Veritas</a>
and made a heavy cherry jaw for it.</p><figure><img src=complete.jpg alt="Figure 6. Completed workbench."><figcaption><p>Figure 6. Completed workbench.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thank you for reading the first post on my woodworking blog. I intend to write
up a record of my past projects, and this was the first one.</p></div><div class=paginator><a></a>
