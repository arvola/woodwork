&lt;p>This is the first real piece of furniture I made, a full-size library cart
as a gift for my wife.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="cart.jpg"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I had recently bought a large amount of cherry. The Woodshop had a big stack
of large cherry pieces from a locally cut down tree, and I bought everything
they had left. I believe it was around 120 board feet. It had lots of
beautiful figure, but without a lot of cracking, so ideal for fine furniture.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="raw-ends.jpg"
alt="Figure 2. Both end pieces from a single board."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 2. Both end pieces from a single board.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I had a good idea of what I wanted the cart to be like, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t look for
existing designs. I wanted it to be sturdy and solid, even if it was
overloaded with books. I did some rough calculations, and it should be
able to handle at least 400 kg of load (900 lb).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="live-edge.jpg"
alt="Figure 3. Live edge before (bottom) and after cleanup."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 3. Live edge before (bottom) and after cleanup.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The pieces for the ends had a nice live edge, so I wanted to preserve it.
I cleaned up the bark with a pullshave, and then cleaned up the top layer
with a spokeshave and a gouge. I cut the opposite side so that the live
edge could be at the front of the cart, and the back a straight cut line
that narrows the cart slightly towards the top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the top of the ends, I rounded it off with a gentle curve, and then
cut a long opening following the curve to create a nice handle for pulling
the cart.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="handle.jpg"
alt="Figure 4. Curved handle at the top."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 4. Curved handle at the top.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Laying out the joinery in the end pieces was a bit more challenging due to
the unusual shape and angle. I butted up the two pieces so that the inside
was facing up, clamped them down to prevent movement, and laid everything
out symmetrically from the middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="layout.jpg"
alt="Figure 5. Laying out the joinery."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 5. Laying out the joinery.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It was slow going, and I was afraid of having issues with the markings not
matching up, but fortunately everything lined up beautifully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to use through tenons for the bottom rails and the top shelf,
and stopped tenons for the rest of the shelves. That way I could be sure
the overall structure held with the addition of wedges to the tenons, but
not adding unnecessary holes to the beautiful wood panels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The large bottom shelf is angled back a little to keep books from sliding
forward as the cart is moved. It also makes it easier to see the spines of
the books. I made sure to leave a small gap at the back between the shelf
and the back board so dust and dirt wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get trapped there.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="ends.jpg"
alt="Figure 6. Ends laid out and cut."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 6. Ends laid out and cut.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I wanted to make sure the bottom of the cart could hold heavy casters,
so instead of using a shelf, I made two heavy rails. The rails are 2&amp;quot;
thick and about 4Â½&amp;quot; wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="rails.jpg"
alt="Figure 7. Rails cut from a thicker piece."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 7. Rails cut from a thicker piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I added a lip to the short middle shelf, so when you push something to the
shelf, there&amp;rsquo;s no chance of it falling out the back. I also added a lip to
the bottom of the top shelf for added rigidity, although I expect that wasn&amp;rsquo;t
really necessary. The top shelf has no lip on top of it, so it&amp;rsquo;s clear for
setting large things on it, or for using it as a table for a laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="lip.jpg"
alt="Figure 8. Gluing a lip to the short shelf."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 8. Gluing a lip to the short shelf.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Thanks to the heavy rails on the bottom, I could use large brass inserts for
holding bolts for the casters. I liked the idea of using the inserts to make
it possible to remove or change the casters without any concern for wearing
out a screw hole in wood.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Lastly, the cart was finished using blonde shellac. After 4 coats, I sanded
the surface to 600 grit, and rubbed it first with steel wool, and then with
pumice and mineral spirits to give it a smooth, dull glow.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After I finished the workbench, I made my first major purchase for
woodworking in the form of a stack of 10 foot long cherry lumber,
and a few pieces of walnut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The walnut was 6/4 (ie. 1.5 inches, or 35 mm), a perfect thickness for
creating a solid foot stool. It was a pretty straight-forward project to attempt,
and I wanted to keep it simple for my first furniture project. This one is
also a &lt;a href="https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/videos/foot-stool-project-info/" target="_blank">Paul Sellers project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="parts.jpg"
alt="Figure 2. Parts cut and shaped."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 2. Parts cut and shaped.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The legs were all shaped by hand using a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokeshave" target="_blank">spokeshave&lt;/a>. I found an
old Stanley 151 for sale at &lt;a href="https://hyperkitten.com/" target="_blank">Hyperkitten Tool Company&lt;/a>,
probably made in the 1910s. Using a spokeshave is very pleasing; it is
a very minimal tool. It&amp;rsquo;s very light and moves without much pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The holes in the base were made with a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_%28tool%29" target="_blank">brace and bit&lt;/a>, and it was
the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve used one. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as challenging to use as I
expected; with the 1&amp;quot; (26 mm) drill bit, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take very long.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="brace.jpg"

&lt;p>Figure 4. Gluing the parts together.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The legs go through the base, with glue on the mating surface. Wedges
are then tapped in with some more glue to create a mechanical joint
in addition to the glue. It&amp;rsquo;s a very strong joint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The protruding parts of the legs were then trimmed and the bottoms
leveled by scribing them on a flat surface. Finally, the stool was
finished with shellac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are quite a few small imperfections on the stool: the legs
don&amp;rsquo;t splay evenly, the tops of the legs have indentations from
scribing a sizing guide, and some tearing is visible in the wood.
They are fairly minor though, and certainly don&amp;rsquo;t detract from its
function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a similar stool about a year and a half later, and it was
clear how much my skills had improved. The second stool was sized
to fit a cat bed so our cats could sit up above the table and
watch us play board games.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For a long time I wanted to get into woodworking. I had some experience through
school, as I always selected woodworking for elective classes. The projects at
school were always relatively simple and largely relied on machines, so that
remained in my mind as the definition of woodworking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on those experiences, I occasionally researched the various machines I
would need to get for starting out. Generally speaking they&amp;rsquo;re either poorly
made or very expensive, and require a lot of room. That made me hold off on
getting started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then one day, by chance, I stumbled upon a series of videos by
&lt;a href="https://paulsellers.com/" target="_blank">Paul Sellers&lt;/a> where he builds a workbench.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru2ZiNs_Wek" target="_blank">&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ru2ZiNs_Wek/hq720.jpg"
alt="Figure 1. How to build a workbench by Paul Sellers"/>&lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 1. How to build a workbench by Paul Sellers&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What really captivated me was the minimal amount of tools used and the
lack of a workshop. There were no machines, no existing workbench, not
even a roof over his head. With a few hand tools and using cheap hardware
store lumber, he built a solid workbench.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt immediately accessible. &amp;ldquo;I could do this,&amp;rdquo; I thought, with minimal
investment. I rented a pickup truck and bought about $150 worth of 2x4 lumber
from a hardware store. I bought a few cheap chisels, a #4 plane by Woodriver,
two hand saws and some clamps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I built two simple sawhorses, and I set an old hollow core door on top.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="workbench_1.jpg"
alt="Figure 2. Gluing the first of the two top slabs."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 2. Gluing the first of the two top slabs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I followed Paul Seller&amp;rsquo;s instructions more or less exactly, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go
into too much detail on the build itself. One difference was that the wood
I got had much more rounded corners and wasn&amp;rsquo;t as even, so it took more work
to flatten the slabs. To make that easier I bought a second plane, a
&lt;a href="https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/planes/scrub/51871-veritas-scrub-plane" target="_blank">Veritas scrub plane&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="hand-tools">Hand tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this point I had watched and read more material by &lt;a href="https://paulsellers.com" target="_blank">Paul Sellers&lt;/a>
about using hand tools for woodworking, and I was finding that I enjoyed
the work immensely - more so than in the past with machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All your senses
tell you about the wood you&amp;rsquo;re working with, rather than the machines. You feel
changes in the growth of the wood rather than vibrations of the tool. You hear
the texture of what you&amp;rsquo;re working with rather than the deafening cacophony of
motors and high-speed blades. You breathe and smell the wood rather than wear
a dust mask constantly. To me it feels more like crafting with skill rather than just
building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t say that to seem somehow superior, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just my
preference. Power tools and machines have their advantages as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall hand tools take more time and effort, but I&amp;rsquo;m not in any hurry - it is a
hobby after all. Hand tools are also more of a learning experience, it takes a lot of
practice to use them effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do still occasionally use power tools. I have a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_%28tool%29" target="_blank">brace&lt;/a> that I typically
use for larger holes, but for smaller ones I use a power drill. When I occasionally
need plywood panels, I usually cut those with a circular saw.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The only major change from the original was that I used a different vise. I got
a &lt;a href="https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/workshop/workbenches/vises/67755-veritas-quick-release-front-vise?item=05G3401" target="_blank">vise mechanism by Veritas&lt;/a>
and made a heavy cherry jaw for it.&lt;/p>
