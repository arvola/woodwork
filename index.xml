&lt;p>For a long time I wanted to get into woodworking. I had some experience through
school, as I always selected woodworking for elective classes. The projects at
school were always relatively simple and largely relied on machines, so that
remained in my mind as the definition of woodworking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on those experiences, I occasionally researched the various machines I
would need to get for starting out. Generally speaking they&amp;rsquo;re either poorly
made or very expensive, and require a lot of room. That made me hold off on
getting started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then one day, by chance, I stumbled upon a series of videos by
&lt;a href="https://paulsellers.com/" target="_blank">Paul Sellers&lt;/a>
where he builds a workbench.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru2ZiNs_Wek" target="_blank">&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ru2ZiNs_Wek/hq720.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What really captivated me was the minimal amount of tools used and the
lack of a workshop. There were no machines, no existing workbench, not
even a roof over his head. With a few hand tools and using cheap hardware
store lumber, he built a solid workbench.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt immediately accessible. &amp;ldquo;I could do this,&amp;rdquo; I thought, with minimal
investment. I rented a pickup truck and bought about $150 worth of 2x4 lumber
from a hardware store. I bought a few cheap chisels, a #4 plane by Woodriver,
two hand saws and some clamps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I built two simple sawhorses, and I set an old hollow core door on top.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I followed Paul Seller&amp;rsquo;s instructions more or less exactly, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go
into too much detail on the build itself. One difference was that the wood
I got had much more rounded corners and wasn&amp;rsquo;t as even, so it took more work
to flatten the slabs. To make that easier I bought a second plane, a
&lt;a href="https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/planes/scrub/51871-veritas-scrub-plane" target="_blank">Veritas scrub plane&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At this point I had watched and read more material by &lt;a href="https://paulsellers.com" target="_blank">Paul Sellers&lt;/a>
about using hand tools for woodworking, and I was finding that I enjoyed
the work immensely - more so than in the past with machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All your senses
tell you about the wood you&amp;rsquo;re working with, rather than the machines. You feel
changes in the growth of the wood rather than vibrations of the tool. You hear
the texture of what you&amp;rsquo;re working with rather than the deafening cacophony of
motors and high-speed blades. You breathe and smell the wood rather than wear
a dust mask constantly. To me it feels more like crafting with skill rather than just
building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t say that to seem somehow superior, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just my
preference. Power tools and machines have their advantages as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall hand tools take more time and effort, but I&amp;rsquo;m not in any hurry - it is a
hobby after all. Hand tools are also more of a learning experience, it takes a lot of
practice to use them effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do still occasionally use power tools. I have a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_%28tool%29" target="_blank">brace&lt;/a>
that I typically
use for larger holes, but for smaller ones I use a power drill. When I occasionally
need plywood panels, I usually cut those with a circular saw.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The only major change from the original was that I used a different vise. I got
a &lt;a href="https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/workshop/workbenches/vises/67755-veritas-quick-release-front-vise?item=05G3401" target="_blank">vise mechanism by Veritas&lt;/a>
and made a heavy cherry jaw for it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thank you for reading the first post on my woodworking blog. I intend to write
up a record of my past projects, and this was the first one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>This will be a simple site logging my woodworking experiences.&lt;/p>

.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo&lt;/a>
is responsible for turning the content into
a website. I considered others as well, but Hugo seems to have the best
support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The site is hosted on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System" target="_blank">IPFS&lt;/a>
,
with the help of &lt;a href="https://www.pinata.cloud/" target="_blank">Pinata&lt;/a>

&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare&lt;/a>
makes the website accessible through a normal
browser, instead of needing to support IPFS.&lt;/li>

I enjoy the academic look of LaTeX.&lt;/li>
