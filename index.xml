&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a handful of kitchen utensils from a board of olive wood I got
from the Woodshop. &lt;a href="https://www.wood-database.com/olive/" target="_blank">Olive&lt;/a> is
a beautiful wood, it has very small, diffuse
pores that are easy to cover with any finish. It is heavy and very hard,
which is good for utensils. It is fairly unstable, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really
matter for utensils, as warping doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any real difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="olive.jpg"
alt="Figure 2. The olive wood board."/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>When working with olive, you can immediately smell the pleasant, fruity
aroma, similar to olive oil. It is known as a
&lt;a href="https://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/wood-allergies-and-toxicity/#sensitizer" target="_blank">sensitizer&lt;/a>,
so it&amp;rsquo;s best to
avoid long periods of working only on olive wood, exposure to the dust
over time can sensitize you to the wood and start causing allergic reactions.
Fortunately, that is not a concern for finished pieces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I start by drawing an outline of the utensil on a rectangular piece of wood.
I try to align it such that the grain follows the handle as much as possible,
while avoiding any obvious cracks.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="outline.jpg"
alt="Figure 3. Drawing the outline for a spatula."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 3. Drawing the outline for a spatula.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>With spoons, I carve the bowl first before anything else, since that&amp;rsquo;s easier
in dry wood while the piece is easy to clamp. I carve the bowl using the two
gauges I own: a large 1½ inch with a gentler sweep, and a ¾ inch half-circle.
Both have bevels on the outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, I use a curved &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_scraper" target="_blank">scraper&lt;/a>
to smooth the gouge marks out, and finish with sandpapers up to 600 grit.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="sawing.jpg"
alt="Figure 4. After sawing the handle shape."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 4. After sawing the handle shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I remove as much material as possible using saws, and then do the
shaping using chisels and a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokeshave" target="_blank">spokeshave&lt;/a>.
Final smoothing is done using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_scraper" target="_blank">card scraper&lt;/a> and sandpapers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I converted a few of the pieces into bowls instead of spoons due to cracks
or cavities in the wood that would be unsuitable for a spoon, but would be
fine in a bowl for dry goods. They are done using the same tools and methods,
just without a handle.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantele" target="_blank">kantele&lt;/a> is a traditional
Finnish box zither, a string instrument. It is typically plucked or
strummed, but can also be used with a bow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since it was my first time building one, I found some pre-existing plans
from &lt;a href="http://www.michaeljking.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Michael J King&lt;/a>. The plans
provided all the necessary information for sizing and placement for the
tuning pins.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="plan.jpg"
alt="Figure 2. Printed paper plan for the soundboard."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 2. Printed paper plan for the soundboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I found some nice quarter-sawn sapele for the soundboard, a beautiful
wood that&amp;rsquo;s also a decent tone wood. The sides of the frame are also
from the same board of sapele, and then for the rest I chose hard maple
as a good wood for holding the tuning pins and the stock steel bar.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When gluing the frame, I inserted a few dowels between the maple and
the sapele sides to stop movement during gluing. I added an additional piece
of sapele on the bottom of the maple head to complete the frame, and then
did shaping using chisels, gouges, rasps and files to finish off the shape
of the frame.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="frame.jpg"
alt="Figure 6. Completed frame."/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Next, it was time to attach the soundboard. I cut it to a very rough shape
first for gluing it to the frame, and then trimmed it down to match the
frame after.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="soundboard.jpg"
alt="Figure 7. Gluing on the soundboard."/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I wanted to add some accent between the soundboard and the maple head,
so I made some strips of wood from bloodwood and wenge. The red and dark
colors complement the otherwise fairly light instrument very nicely.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With the frame and the soundboard complete, it only remained to add the main
stock that holds the steel bar for the strings to attach. I spent a lot of
time shaping the stock, since that&amp;rsquo;s where the player&amp;rsquo;s right hand rests most
of the time.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Before proceeding to add the hardware parts, I added the finish to the wood.
I wanted to do a classic french polishing, which is basically rubbing on
very, very thin layers of shellac to build up a hundred or more layers
of finish. It&amp;rsquo;s time-consuming, but the outcome is stunning. Unfortunately
I forgot to take pictures of the process.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Figure 1. Finished cat shrine.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I designed a shrine to hold the ashes
and paw prints of our passed cats, with room for decorations and, of course,
live cats as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several pieces of a pile of local cherry I bought had some highly figured
crotch at the ends of the boards. The design highlights the unusual figure
of those boards as a wide open shelf. I even left some of the bark on, and
just strengthened it with shellac.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="bottom.jpg"
alt="Figure 2. Figure on the bottom shelf."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 2. Figure on the bottom shelf.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>At the left, I attached a side board using dovetails to the bottom shelf,
and then using a rabbet in the side board attached a back panel for the
smaller shelves. The back is also attached to the bottom using a dowel,
but that&amp;rsquo;s only near the left edge to allow for wood movement.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The shelves were glued in mostly to the left board as well, rather than the
back. I wanted to make sure the movement of the back panel would not cause
issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added little pegs to the perimiter of the small shelves to make sure cats
couldn&amp;rsquo;t knock the boxes out of the shelves. The pegs I made from a long dowel
of walnut&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is the first real piece of furniture I made, a full-size library cart
as a gift for my wife.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="cart.jpg"
alt="Figure 1. The finished cart."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 1. The finished cart.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I had recently bought a large amount of cherry. The Woodshop had a big stack
of large cherry pieces from a locally cut down tree, and I bought everything
they had left. I believe it was around 120 board feet. It had lots of
beautiful figure, but without a lot of cracking, so ideal for fine furniture.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="raw-ends.jpg"
alt="Figure 2. Both end pieces from a single board."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 2. Both end pieces from a single board.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I had a good idea of what I wanted the cart to be like, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t look for
existing designs. I wanted it to be sturdy and solid, even if it was
overloaded with books. I did some rough calculations, and it should be
able to handle at least 400 kg of load (900 lb).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="live-edge.jpg"
alt="Figure 3. Live edge before (bottom) and after cleanup."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 3. Live edge before (bottom) and after cleanup.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The pieces for the ends had a nice live edge, so I wanted to preserve it.
I cleaned up the bark with a pullshave, and then cleaned up the top layer
with a spokeshave and a gouge. I cut the opposite side so that the live
edge could be at the front of the cart, and the back a straight cut line
that narrows the cart slightly towards the top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the top of the ends, I rounded it off with a gentle curve, and then
cut a long opening following the curve to create a nice handle for pulling
the cart.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="handle.jpg"
alt="Figure 4. Curved handle at the top."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 4. Curved handle at the top.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Laying out the joinery in the end pieces was a bit more challenging due to
the unusual shape and angle. I butted up the two pieces so that the inside
was facing up, clamped them down to prevent movement, and laid everything
out symmetrically from the middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="layout.jpg"
alt="Figure 5. Laying out the joinery."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 5. Laying out the joinery.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It was slow going, and I was afraid of having issues with the markings not
matching up, but fortunately everything lined up beautifully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to use through tenons for the bottom rails and the top shelf,
and stopped tenons for the rest of the shelves. That way I could be sure
the overall structure held with the addition of wedges to the tenons, but
not adding unnecessary holes to the beautiful wood panels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The large bottom shelf is angled back a little to keep books from sliding
forward as the cart is moved. It also makes it easier to see the spines of
the books. I made sure to leave a small gap at the back between the shelf
and the back board so dust and dirt wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get trapped there.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="ends.jpg"
alt="Figure 6. Ends laid out and cut."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 6. Ends laid out and cut.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I wanted to make sure the bottom of the cart could hold heavy casters,
so instead of using a shelf, I made two heavy rails. The rails are 2&amp;quot;
thick and about 4½&amp;quot; wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="rails.jpg"
alt="Figure 7. Rails cut from a thicker piece."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 7. Rails cut from a thicker piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I added a lip to the short middle shelf, so when you push something to the
shelf, there&amp;rsquo;s no chance of it falling out the back. I also added a lip to
the bottom of the top shelf for added rigidity, although I expect that wasn&amp;rsquo;t
really necessary. The top shelf has no lip on top of it, so it&amp;rsquo;s clear for
setting large things on it, or for using it as a table for a laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="lip.jpg"
alt="Figure 8. Gluing a lip to the short shelf."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 8. Gluing a lip to the short shelf.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Thanks to the heavy rails on the bottom, I could use large brass inserts for
holding bolts for the casters. I liked the idea of using the inserts to make
it possible to remove or change the casters without any concern for wearing
out a screw hole in wood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After I finished the workbench, I made my first major purchase for
woodworking in the form of a stack of 10 foot long cherry lumber,
and a few pieces of walnut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The walnut was 6/4 (ie. 1.5 inches, or 35 mm), a perfect thickness for
creating a solid foot stool. It was a pretty straight-forward project to attempt,
and I wanted to keep it simple for my first furniture project. This one is
also a &lt;a href="https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/videos/foot-stool-project-info/" target="_blank">Paul Sellers project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The legs were all shaped by hand using a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokeshave" target="_blank">spokeshave&lt;/a>. I found an
old Stanley 151 for sale at &lt;a href="https://hyperkitten.com/" target="_blank">Hyperkitten Tool Company&lt;/a>,
probably made in the 1910s. Using a spokeshave is very pleasing; it is
a very minimal tool. It&amp;rsquo;s very light and moves without much pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The holes in the base were made with a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_%28tool%29" target="_blank">brace and bit&lt;/a>, and it was
the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve used one. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as challenging to use as I
expected; with the 1&amp;quot; (26 mm) drill bit, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take very long.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The legs go through the base, with glue on the mating surface. Wedges
are then tapped in with some more glue to create a mechanical joint
in addition to the glue. It&amp;rsquo;s a very strong joint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The protruding parts of the legs were then trimmed and the bottoms
leveled by scribing them on a flat surface. Finally, the stool was
finished with shellac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are quite a few small imperfections on the stool: the legs
don&amp;rsquo;t splay evenly, the tops of the legs have indentations from
scribing a sizing guide, and some tearing is visible in the wood.
They are fairly minor though, and certainly don&amp;rsquo;t detract from its
function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a similar stool about a year and a half later, and it was
clear how much my skills had improved. The second stool was sized
to fit a cat bed so our cats could sit up above the table and
watch us play board games.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For a long time I wanted to get into woodworking. I had some experience through
school, as I always selected woodworking for elective classes. The projects at
school were always relatively simple and largely relied on machines, so that
remained in my mind as the definition of woodworking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on those experiences, I occasionally researched the various machines I
would need to get for starting out. Generally speaking they&amp;rsquo;re either poorly
made or very expensive, and require a lot of room. That made me hold off on
getting started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then one day, by chance, I stumbled upon a series of videos by
&lt;a href="https://paulsellers.com/" target="_blank">Paul Sellers&lt;/a> where he builds a workbench.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru2ZiNs_Wek" target="_blank">&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ru2ZiNs_Wek/hq720.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What really captivated me was the minimal amount of tools used and the
lack of a workshop. There were no machines, no existing workbench, not
even a roof over his head. With a few hand tools and using cheap hardware
store lumber, he built a solid workbench.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt immediately accessible. &amp;ldquo;I could do this,&amp;rdquo; I thought, with minimal
investment. I rented a pickup truck and bought about $150 worth of 2x4 lumber
from a hardware store. I bought a few cheap chisels, a #4 plane by Woodriver,
two hand saws and some clamps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I built two simple sawhorses, and I set an old hollow core door on top.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="workbench_1.jpg"
alt="Figure 2. Gluing the first of the two top slabs."/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>Figure 2. Gluing the first of the two top slabs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I followed Paul Seller&amp;rsquo;s instructions more or less exactly, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go
into too much detail on the build itself. One difference was that the wood
I got had much more rounded corners and wasn&amp;rsquo;t as even, so it took more work
to flatten the slabs. To make that easier I bought a second plane, a
&lt;a href="https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/planes/scrub/51871-veritas-scrub-plane" target="_blank">Veritas scrub plane&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="hand-tools">Hand tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this point I had watched and read more material by &lt;a href="https://paulsellers.com" target="_blank">Paul Sellers&lt;/a>
about using hand tools for woodworking, and I was finding that I enjoyed
the work immensely - more so than in the past with machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All your senses
tell you about the wood you&amp;rsquo;re working with, rather than the machines. You feel
changes in the growth of the wood rather than vibrations of the tool. You hear
the texture of what you&amp;rsquo;re working with rather than the deafening cacophony of
motors and high-speed blades. You breathe and smell the wood rather than wear
a dust mask constantly. To me it feels more like crafting with skill rather than just
building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t say that to seem somehow superior, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just my
preference. Power tools and machines have their advantages as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall hand tools take more time and effort, but I&amp;rsquo;m not in any hurry - it is a
hobby after all. Hand tools are also more of a learning experience, it takes a lot of
practice to use them effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do still occasionally use power tools. I have a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_%28tool%29" target="_blank">brace&lt;/a> that I typically
use for larger holes, but for smaller ones I use a power drill. When I occasionally
need plywood panels, I usually cut those with a circular saw.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The only major change from the original was that I used a different vise. I got
a &lt;a href="https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/workshop/workbenches/vises/67755-veritas-quick-release-front-vise?item=05G3401" target="_blank">vise mechanism by Veritas&lt;/a>
and made a heavy cherry jaw for it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thank you for reading the first post on my woodworking blog. I intend to write
up a record of my past projects, and this was the first one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>This will be a simple site logging my woodworking experiences.&lt;/p>
